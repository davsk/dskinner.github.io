			 	<h1>Line 6 UX2 and Linux</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 24, 2010</span>
			      <p>I originally wrote a bad/sad review about the Line 6 UX2 not working under linux as can be seen here:
<a href="http://line6.com/community/thread/17663">http://line6.com/community/thread/17663</a></p>

<p>I was looking to sell it recently when I decided to give it another look over and try out the drivers done for the PodXT devices by someone as can be found here:
<a href="http://www.tanzband-scream.at/line6/">http://www.tanzband-scream.at/line6/</a></p>

<p>The 0.8.1 release failed to compile so i checked out the trunk of the development version</p>

<pre><code>svn co https://line6linux.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/line6linux
cd line6linux/driver/trunk
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>To my surprise, it worked fairly ok. My line 6 ux2 device lit up and seemed ready to go. One of the first things I noticed was that there was a constant buzzing out of the right channel monitor. This was alleviated by simply plugging my guitar in. Next, I read through the docs to get some general info. I went ahead and fired up alsamixer, increased pcm output and zero&rsquo;d out the monitor. Note: the docs say to set pcm output to zero as they can be much louder then the guitar monitor. I had no trouble with this when i increased output to 75, volume was normal.</p>

<p>So then I fired up jack and played around with a couple settings. To my surprise I was able to get latency down to 1.5 ms according to ardour (2.87 according to qjackctl)! Either way, this was much lower then I ever managed with my edirol which normally clocked in around 15ms and was littered with xruns that were very audible in the recording. Normally around 22ms I could achieve good sound with no xruns. After a short recording session, I noticed qjackctl had logged numerous xruns but I never heard a thing. Once during the recording, ardour disconnected from jack but this could be totally unrelated.</p>

<p>This is fine news indeed and prompts me to want to hold on to this device. The bad news is I have been unable to get the microphone inputs working. I haven&rsquo;t had time to look into it fully but hopefully after exploring the line6linux docs some more, I can have some success with getting this working.</p>

<p>So all in all, this is great. What I would really like to see is Line6 spend a few resources on this project or doing something themselves. But that aside, hardware wise (i guess), this little bugger rocks!</p>
