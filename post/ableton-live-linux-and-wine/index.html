			      <p>Well, a title doesn&rsquo;t get much more concise then that I guess. For anyone ever interested in running ableton live in a linux platform of their choice via wine, it has been disheartening to say the least. Mainly due to a direct draw issue thats been around for a while. Well a couple days ago the issue was resolved with wine 1.1.3 and ableton is now very usable! I installed Ableton Live 6 on my laptop after getting wind of the possible fix, started the app and immediately noticed it was copying files to the library! Normally ableton dumps the dialog here, doesn&rsquo;t copy anything, and presents you with an empty &ldquo;this is an evaluation&rdquo; blah blah blah empty dialog where i have to click an invisible button. Well long story short, its working and working very well.</p>

<p>There are a couple of issues ive noted thus far that i need to open bugs for or find bugs already opened for. One, when i arm a track for recording in live, it prompts me with an error message saying it can&rsquo;t open such and such a file for writing. Also while working with a simple project of dragging in some songs and doing some loops everything went fine, with a more complex project of dragging in loops, samples, and other fun stuff and throwing in some midi sequences and effects and more fun stuff, well.. everything went great! and then i saved it, and then later i went to open it and it couldn&rsquo;t find a file related to the project, but it was looking somewhere i wouldn&rsquo;t normally expect ableton to look (i dont think..). If i recall correctly, im pretty sure ableton live records loops and junk into a folder of the name of the project, but instead it was looking for a file from my ~/Samples/Recorded/ folder. I dunno maybe thats right, but that folder is empty and the file its asking for i cannot slocate on my hard drive so i dunno ..</p>

<p>Once these quirky file issues go aside and i can save complex projects without any hitches, id probably give it a platinum status b/c it runs damn smooth.</p>

<p>Edit: Just to note, im using Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 and the repo&rsquo;s from winehq.org</p>
