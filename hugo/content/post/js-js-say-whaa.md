whaa? oh, right. Well Ive dug in deep to javascript. Well sorta, and it was all in an effort to evaluate whether to use prototype.js or mootools. My choice? neither. Instead I'll focus my energy on expanding the default object in my js.js file. I know, its totally unoriginal. But lets face the facts, its 488 bytes.

And hot damn its amazing what 488 bytes can do. You can check it out here:

Ive placed it in the public domain and what not. I think the focus will be mostly on custom constructors and lettings prototype() paste it all together. And of course, it can just be a staging ground for continued explicit prototypal declaration. It just uses whats there, and thats pretty sweet.
