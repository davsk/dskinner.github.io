Ive only recently started blogging and there were two choices that came to mind. Wordpress, which ive heard about and a rather famous blogging util, and blogger, which i once looked at many years ago and also integrates with my other google services. I figured i would give both a go and after a few hours of accumulative use, I decided i liked blogger best as i accomplished what i wanted more quickly. Unfortunately i noticed that nothing i posted in blogger showed up as a google search result, whereas my post in wordpress would show up as a first result, when typing in two keywords, overnight! Since my utmost main concern is access to my meager blog, I will be discontinuing my use of blogger but leaving it up incase it was indexed by some other service. Here is a Link to both blogs
